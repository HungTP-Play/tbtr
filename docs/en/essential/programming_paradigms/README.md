## Overview of common programming paradigms

Here are some of the common programming paradigms you might want to include in your Software Engineer's Essentials repository:

* **Imperative Programming:** This is a foundational paradigm where the programmer explicitly instructs the computer on how to perform a sequence of steps to achieve a desired outcome. Examples include C, Java, and Python.

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** This paradigm organizes code around "objects" that encapsulate data (attributes) and the operations that can be performed on that data (methods). It promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability. Examples include Java, C++, and Python.

* **Functional Programming:** This paradigm focuses on pure functions, which take inputs and produce outputs without causing side effects (changes to global state). It emphasizes immutability and declarative programming (describing what you want, not how to achieve it). Examples include Haskell, Scala, and JavaScript (functional features).

* **Declarative Programming:** This paradigm focuses on describing the desired outcome rather than the specific steps to achieve it. The  compiler or interpreter figures out the "how" based on the provided rules. Examples include SQL (database queries), HTML (web page structure), and declarative aspects of languages like Lisp and Prolog.

* **Logic Programming:** This paradigm uses logic statements and rules to solve problems. The programmer defines facts and rules, and the interpreter searches for solutions based on those definitions. Examples include Prolog and Answer Set Programming (ASP).
